## Examples
Note that cf-neptune is compiled into ES5, thus supports all major browsers, but the [examples](./examples) are written in ES6, you may need a modern browser to run examples properly.

To run examples:
* Navigate to the root folder
* `yarn` installs dependencies
* `yarn build` builds the project
* Go to `examples` folder, you can run individual example by opening the example file
